`get_sample_names.py` is a (barely) interactive script which lists info about all PacBio Sequel II runs found on a given hard drive. It is designed to work on windows in that it uses a letter to identify the drive with the sequence data. Usage on another OS would probably require modifications for this reason. This script was used to generate the data found in the [DNASC catalog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10j-XyYrslPSi779Z4AHcE-D9rjlnP263jLFP9nM6lns/edit?usp=sharing).
